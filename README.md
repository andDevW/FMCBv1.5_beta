# FMCB v1.5 beta

FMCB v1.5 beta is an early version of FMCB that predates the FMCB splash screen.
The blank/empty screen just prior to the PS2 boot sequence is slightly longer than on a stock PS2.
Works with PS2 launch consoles SCPH-30001 and SCPH-10000.
Newer versions of FMCB support a much wider range of PS2 models.
